    <img src="images/cabbage.jpg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This cabbage, potato, and sausage skillet is a flavor-filled comfort food skillet full of potatoes, cabbage, onions, and sausage that’s humble and budget-friendly. Place a bottle of hot sauce on the table for those who enjoy a little spiciness.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>12 ounces precooked apple chicken sausage links (such as Trader Joe’s®)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds potatoes, unpeeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 onion, halved and sliced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>5 cups coarsely chopped cabbage</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add sausage to the skillet, and cook, flipping occasionally, until lightly browned on both sides, about 5 to 8 minutes. Remove sausage; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining oil in the skillet; stir in potatoes and onions. Cook and stir until potatoes just begin to  brown lightly; add chicken broth and cover the skillet. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are golden brown, 12 to 17 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cabbage, garlic powder, and paprika, and stir well. Cook until cabbage is soft and tender, 6 to 8 minutes more. Return sausage to the skillet, and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
